          <h1>Cyber Knight</h1>
          <p><strong>Author:</strong> Reila Arvier</p>
          <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Fantasy, Romance, Adventure</p>
          <p><strong>Published:</strong> xxxx</p>
          <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> Rheala is one of the last surviving units of 
            the outlawed program known as <i>Peony</i>. As the final test subject created by 
            the Peony researchers, she was discovered in a cryogenic tube by Jake—a former 
            Cyber Knight turned mercenary. Now known by the codename <b>λ-03</b>, Jake fights 
            as part of the revolutionary faction known as <i>The Ashen Vanguard</i>, a group 
            determined to overthrow the oppressive regime of Neo Light Nexus.<br><br>

            Together, Rheala, Jake, and the Ashen Vanguard strive to dismantle the corrupt 
            governors who erected the towering walls of Neo Light Nexus, dividing the privileged 
            core from the desolate outskirts. Their mission is also a reckoning with the legacy of 
            the <i>Hollow Flux</i>, a catastrophic event from ten years ago that continues to haunt the 
            city and its people.</p>
